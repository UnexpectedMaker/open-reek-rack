# open-reel-rack
Storage project for electronics component reels

Your currently find STEP files for Rack Ends, an 8mm reel divider and an 8mm lever in the repo.

This is all just a temporary staging area to be able to share files early.

Files are designed to be added to 2020 Extrusion.

## Using the files and contributing back
Feel free to use these, and modify them for your needs, but if you do modify them, please contribute your changes back to the repo by creating a folder inside the *remixes* folder, with your name or handle, and an explanation your changes in a readme, maybe with some screenshots showing your assembled rack or pics of the pieces you've changed.

## Prusa Printables & Thingiverse
If you make changes to my original design files, please don't submit them as new designs or remixes to sites like Prusa Printables, Thingiverse etc. Please contribute them back here so everything is kept inside the main repo.

Distributing variations on other websites hinders the growth of this project, and makes it difficult for those wanting to find and use the project from understanding what contributions are available to them.

Thanks :)
