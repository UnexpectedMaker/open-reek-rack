# open-reel-rack design files by Unexpected Maker
These are the original design files in STEP format

Feel free to use these, and modify them for your needs, but if you do modify them, please contribute your changes back to the repo by creating a folder with your name or handle, inside the *remixes* folder, and explain your changes in a readme, maybe with some screenshots showing your assembled rack or pics of the pieces you've changed.
